One sunny morning, as Pixel was typing away on his keyboard, he heard a soft whimper coming from outside. Curious, he opened the window to find a scruffy little dog sitting on the doorstep, wagging his tail and looking up at Pixel with big, soulful eyes. The dog's name was Sparky, and he had a mischievous twinkle in his eye that immediately captured Pixel's heart.
