One crisp, sunny morning, Fluffy was frolicking through the wildflowers when a gentle breeze carried a soft, yet urgent whisper. The whisper spoke of a distant land trapped in an eternal twilight, governed by a mysterious darknessâ€”a place where no petal bloomed and no leaf fluttered. This realm was desperately in need of light, of hope. Fluffy, with his heart brimming with adventure, decided that he would be the one to brighten that dark world.
