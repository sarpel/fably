Once upon a time, in the far-off galaxy of Spinneret, there was a small, peaceful planet known as Whimsiloon. Whimsiloon was a spectacular place, with skies painted in vibrant hues of orange and pink, and grass that shimmered like emerald under the twin suns. The Whimsians, cheerful creatures with twinkling blue eyes and gentle smiles, lived there.
