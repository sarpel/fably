Ello embarked on a journey across the rolling hills of Whimsiloon to seek the wisdom of the ancient Oracle, a wise being who lived atop the highest peak of Mount Glimmerhorn. Along the way, Ello met a variety of creatures: Mip, the flying squirrel who knew every corner of the forest; Tula, the singing river fish whose melodies could soothe even the angriest of hearts; and Bree, the strong yet gentle giant who could move mountains.
