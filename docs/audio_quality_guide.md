# Audio Quality Improvements - User Guide

## Overview

Fably now includes **Advanced Audio Quality Improvements** featuring noise reduction, ambient sound filtering, and enhanced voice detection. These improvements significantly reduce false triggers from household noise while maintaining excellent voice recognition quality.

## Features

### üîá Noise Reduction System
- **Ambient Noise Filtering**: Automatically filters out background sounds below threshold
- **Adaptive Noise Gate**: Dynamic audio gating based on measured noise floor
- **False Trigger Prevention**: Dramatically reduces unwanted activations from TV, music, or household sounds

### üìä Noise Floor Calibration
- **Automatic Calibration**: Measures your room's ambient noise level during startup
- **Manual Calibration**: Control calibration duration and sensitivity settings
- **Smart Defaults**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible fallback settings

### üéöÔ∏è Customizable Audio Processing
- **Sensitivity Control**: Adjust noise gate sensitivity (0.1-10.0 range)
- **Calibration Duration**: Set measurement time (1-10 seconds)
- **Enable/Disable**: Full control over noise reduction features

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Recommended)

Enable noise reduction with automatic calibration:

```bash
# Enable noise reduction with auto-calibration
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --loop

# The system will:
# 1. Measure ambient noise for 3 seconds during startup
# 2. Set optimal noise threshold automatically
# 3. Filter audio input during voice recording
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Custom sensitivity (higher = more sensitive to quiet sounds)
fably --noise-reduction --noise-sensitivity 3.0 --auto-calibrate

# Custom calibration duration
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --calibration-duration 5.0

# Manual noise floor (skip auto-calibration)
fably --noise-reduction --noise-sensitivity 1.5
```

### Voice Commands with Noise Reduction

```bash
# Start in loop mode with noise reduction
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --loop

# Voice commands work normally:
# "Tell me a story about dragons"
# "Continue the story about the princess"
# "What happens next?"
```

## Configuration Parameters

### --noise-reduction
**Type**: Flag  
**Default**: False  
**Description**: Enable noise reduction and audio filtering system

```bash
fably --noise-reduction  # Enable noise reduction
```

### --noise-sensitivity
**Type**: Float (0.1 - 10.0)  
**Default**: 2.0  
**Description**: Noise gate sensitivity multiplier

- **Lower values (0.5-1.5)**: Less sensitive, filters more aggressively
- **Higher values (2.0-5.0)**: More sensitive, allows quieter sounds through
- **Very high (5.0+)**: Minimal filtering, good for very quiet environments

```bash
fably --noise-reduction --noise-sensitivity 1.0  # Aggressive filtering
fably --noise-reduction --noise-sensitivity 3.0  # Sensitive to quiet voices
```

### --calibration-duration
**Type**: Float (1.0 - 10.0 seconds)  
**Default**: 3.0  
**Description**: Duration to record ambient noise for calibration

```bash
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --calibration-duration 5.0
```

### --auto-calibrate
**Type**: Flag  
**Default**: False  
**Description**: Automatically measure noise floor during startup

```bash
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate
```

## How It Works

### Noise Floor Calibration Process

1. **Environment Sampling**: Records ambient room noise for specified duration
2. **Energy Analysis**: Calculates RMS (Root Mean Square) energy of noise samples  
3. **Threshold Setting**: Sets noise gate threshold based on measured levels
4. **Adaptive Filtering**: Applies real-time filtering during voice recording

### Real-Time Audio Processing

1. **Input Capture**: Microphone audio captured in small chunks
2. **Energy Calculation**: Each chunk analyzed for energy content
3. **Threshold Comparison**: Energy compared against calibrated noise floor
4. **Filtering Decision**: Chunks below threshold replaced with silence
5. **Speech Recognition**: Processed audio sent to Vosk for speech detection

### Hybrid Detection System

Fably combines two complementary approaches:

- **Energy-Based Filtering**: Fast, efficient noise gate removes obvious background noise
- **Speech Recognition**: Sophisticated Vosk detection identifies actual speech patterns
- **Combined Benefits**: Robust performance in various acoustic environments

## Recommended Settings

### Home Environment (Typical)
```bash
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --noise-sensitivity 2.0
```
**Use for**: Normal homes with moderate background noise (TV, appliances, conversations)

### Quiet Environment
```bash
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --noise-sensitivity 3.0
```
**Use for**: Bedrooms, studies, quiet rooms where child speaks softly

### Noisy Environment  
```bash
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --noise-sensitivity 1.5
```
**Use for**: Living rooms, kitchens, areas with significant background noise

### Ultra-Quiet Environment
```bash
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --noise-sensitivity 4.0
```
**Use for**: Very quiet spaces where you want maximum sensitivity

## Calibration Best Practices

### During Setup
1. **Representative Environment**: Calibrate when typical background sounds are present
2. **Avoid Speech**: Don't talk during calibration period
3. **Normal Activity**: Keep normal household sounds (TV, appliances) at typical levels
4. **Positioning**: Ensure microphone is in its normal operating position

### Example Calibration Session
```bash
$ fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --calibration-duration 4.0 --loop

INFO: Auto-calibrating noise floor...
INFO: Calibrating noise floor for 4.0 seconds...
INFO: Noise floor calibrated: 0.002847 (from 64 samples)
INFO: Ready for voice commands
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Voice commands not detected"

**Possible Causes**:
- Noise sensitivity too low (aggressive filtering)
- Child speaking too quietly
- Microphone positioning issues

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Increase sensitivity
fably --noise-reduction --noise-sensitivity 3.0 --auto-calibrate

# Check without noise reduction
fably --loop  # Test basic functionality

# Re-calibrate in different conditions
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --calibration-duration 5.0
```

### "Too many false triggers"

**Possible Causes**:
- Noise sensitivity too high
- Calibration in too-quiet environment
- Background noise varies significantly

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Reduce sensitivity
fably --noise-reduction --noise-sensitivity 1.0 --auto-calibrate

# Re-calibrate with typical background noise
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate

# Disable noise reduction temporarily
fably --loop
```

### "Inconsistent performance"

**Possible Causes**:
- Background noise levels vary throughout day
- Child's speaking volume inconsistent
- Microphone position changes

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use moderate sensitivity
fably --noise-reduction --noise-sensitivity 2.0 --auto-calibrate

# Longer calibration period
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --calibration-duration 6.0

# Re-calibrate when environment changes significantly
```

```

No configuration files need updating. All noise reduction features are additive and optional.

## Performance Tuning

### For Maximum Accuracy
```bash
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --noise-sensitivity 2.5 --calibration-duration 5.0
```

### For Maximum Efficiency  
```bash
fably --noise-reduction --noise-sensitivity 2.0  # Skip auto-calibration
```

### For Debugging
```bash
fably --noise-reduction --auto-calibrate --debug  # Verbose logging
```

This enhancement makes Fably significantly more robust in real-world home environments while maintaining the same magical storytelling experience for children.
